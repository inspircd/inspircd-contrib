/* Documentation
   This module is used to completely block DCC from being used on your
   IRC network in all cases.  Previous work-arounds to accomplish this
   included configuring m_dccallow to block DCC by default and adding an
   extra clause to disable DCCALLOW for non-operators, but there are
   some cases where it is best to make sure DCC is off for everyone,
   operators included.  This module does this simply and without extra
   configuration required.

   Note: You should not load m_dccallow.so simultaneously to m_dccblock.so
   because it will do nothing useful.  It wouldn't prevent this module from
   blocking DCC however.
